<h3><a name="Editor-s-note" class="anchor" href="#Editor-s-note">Editor's note</a></h3>
<p>The six-week feast of rugby ends with a truly wonderful New Zealand team triumphant once more. Amongst others, we say farewell to
perhaps the greatest centre pairing, fly-half and captain of all time - and welcome a host of youngsters with very bright futures.</p>
<p>Several games will live long in the memory, including Samoa vs Scotland, Tonga vs Georgia, New Zealand vs Argentina, Namibia vs Georgia
and Australia vs Scotland. My top three highlights (in no particular order) would be: Johnny Redelinghuys' attempted conversion; Karne
Hesketh's match-winning try for Japan against South Africa; and the entirety of the Ireland vs Argentina quarter-final. (Denis may
disagree.)</p>
<p>My "matchday squad" of the tournament:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coach: Eddie Jones (Japan)</li>
<li>FB -- 15: Ben Smith (New Zealand)</li>
<li>RW -- 14: Santiago Cordero (Argentina)</li>
<li>OC -- 13: Conrad Smith (New Zealand)</li>
<li>IC -- 12: Ma'a Nonu (New Zealand)</li>
<li>LW -- 11: Nemani Nadolo (Fiji)</li>
<li>FH -- 10: Nicolas Sanchez (Argentina)</li>
<li>SH -- 9: Greig Laidlaw (Scotland)</li>
<li>N8 -- 8: Mamuka Gorgodze (captain) (Georgia)</li>
<li>OF -- 7: David Pocock (Australia)</li>
<li>BF -- 6: Francois Louw (South Africa)</li>
<li>RL -- 5: Sam Whitelock (New Zealand)</li>
<li>LL -- 4: Eben Etzebeth (South Africa)</li>
<li>TP -- 3: Davit Zirakashvili (Georgia)</li>
<li>HK -- 2: Agustin Creevy (Argentina)</li>
<li>LP -- 1: Alasdair Dickinson (Scotland)</li>
<li>HK -- 16: Shota Horie (Japan)</li>
<li>PR -- 17: Marcos Ayerza (Argentina)</li>
<li>PR -- 18: Manasa Saulo (Fiji)</li>
<li>LK -- 19: Leone Nakarawa (Fiji)</li>
<li>FL -- 20: Schalk Burger (South Africa)</li>
<li>SH -- 21: Gareth Davies (Wales)</li>
<li>FH -- 22: Beauden Barrett (New Zealand)</li>
<li>CE -- 23: Matt Giteau (Australia)</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the sweepstake, well, it wasn't as close at the end as it might have been - but I'd say it worked out pretty well for a first
attempt ;) ... I doubt Martyn will be too distraught at winning the wooden spoon of shame, whilst Rosie narrowly pips Hugh to bragging
rights in the Hemmings-Bettesworth household.</p>
<p>Despite a poor showing from his forwards, Jem wins twenty quid for third thanks to strong contributions from Julian Savea, JP Pietersen,
Frederic Michalak and Beauden Barrett.</p>
<p>Neph wins thirty quid for second with big scores from Dan Carter, Adam Ashley-Cooper, Jonathan Sexton, Nemani Nadolo and Francois Louw.</p>
<p>And congratulations to Jack, who takes home fifty quid for first thanks to the efforts of Nicolas Sanchez, Handre Pollard, David Pocock,
Mamuka Gorgodze and Schalk Burger.</p>
<p>In terms of sorting out the prize money, I'm assuming that Susie will bung a tenner to Jem, so I'll e-mail the rest of you shortly with
my bank details - and then pass on most of what I receive to Jack when next I see him.</p>
<p>Thanks everyone for playing. Let's do it again for Japan 2019 - but in the meantime, there's the 18th Anniversary Euro 2016 Sweepstake
to look forward to next summer. Details to follow nearer the time...</p>
<h3><a name="Game-48" class="anchor" href="#Game-48">Game #48</a></h3>
<p><strong>Final: <a href="teams.html#New Zealand">New Zealand</a> 34 - 17 <a href="teams.html#Australia">Australia</a></strong></p>
<p>A stirring second-half fightback from Australia led by the incredible Kurtley Beale falls short as the All Blacks retain the Webb Ellis
Cup in some style. Susie gets the New Zealand win, offset by a yellow card for Ben Smith - which also costs Chris. Hugh picks up a try
from Nehe Milner-Skudder but is pipped to fourth by Rosie thanks to the boot of Bernard Foley. Jem finishes in third after tries from
Tevita Kuridrani and Beauden Barrett. Neph takes second with a brilliant kicking display from man-of-the-match Dan Carter and a superb
try from Ma'a Nonu. And Jack rounds off a dominant performance with a try from David Pocock.</p>
<h3><a name="Injury-update-13" class="anchor" href="#Injury-update-13">Injury update #13</a></h3>
<p>Martyn has picked Joe Moody (New Zealand) as his replacement for Wyatt Crockett.</p>

<p><strong>Bronze final: <a href="teams.html#South Africa">South Africa</a> 24 - 13 <a href="teams.html#Argentina">Argentina</a></strong></p>
<p>Rosie picked Julian Montoya (Argentina) as her replacement for Marcos Ayerza before kick-off.</p>
<p>A game too far for a much-changed Argentina sees South Africa finish third. Jack needlessly extends his lead thanks to the reliable boot
of the wonderful Nicolas Sanchez and the slightly flakier kicking of Handre Pollard. (Let's not mention the worst kick for touch in
recent memory.) Neph drops a couple of points as a result of Tomas Cubelli's early yellow card. Jem closes the gap to second with tries
from JP Pietersen and Eben Etzebeth. Rosie picks up the South African win and still has faint hopes of a top-three finish. Chad scores
via man-of-the-match (and star of the future) Damian de Allende.</p>
<p>Unless I hear from Martyn before kick-off tomorrow, I'll give him Sekope Kepu (Australia) as his replacement for Wyatt Crockett.</p>
<h3><a name="Injury-update-12" class="anchor" href="#Injury-update-12">Injury update #12</a></h3>
<p>Marcos Ayerza (Argentina) and Wyatt Crockett (New Zealand) have been withdrawn through injury and replaced by Santiago Garcia Botta and
Pauliasi Manu respectively.</p>
<p>(Note that although Santiago Garcia Botta was called up less than 48 hours before the Bronze final kick-off, he will be allowed to play
"if absolutely required" because Lucas Noguera Paz will cover hooker from the bench, leaving Argentina with too few fit props.)</p>
<p>Awaiting clarification from Rosie and Martyn as to their replacements for Marcos Ayerza and Wyatt Crockett respectively. (Given that
Martyn is apparently building houses in Nepal, I'll unilaterally pick a replacement if I haven't heard from him before the final.)</p>

<p><strong>Semi-final 2: <a href="teams.html#Argentina">Argentina</a> 15 - 29 <a href="teams.html#Australia">Australia</a></strong></p>
<p>A shaky start leaves Argentina too much to do as Australia's experience and composure take them into the final. Jack benefits from the
boot of Nicolas Sanchez, though Neph trims his lead a little with three tries and a man-of-the-match performance from Adam Ashley-Cooper
(offset by a yellow card for Tomas Lavanini). Rosie picks up a few points after a mixed kicking display from Bernard Foley. Chris moves
up to eighth with the Australia bonus point win.</p>

<p><strong>Semi-final 1: <a href="teams.html#South Africa">South Africa</a> 18 - 20 <a href="teams.html#New Zealand">New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>After the excitement of the quarter-finals, a tense and scrappy game sees the All Blacks through to the final. Jack extends his lead
with another fine kicking display from Handre Pollard. Jem gets a try from the brilliant Beauden Barrett but Neph hangs on to second
thanks to the dependable boot of Dan Carter. Rosie slips back despite the South African bonus point in defeat as a yellow card for Bryan
Habana proves doubly costly. Susie gets the New Zealand win, offset by a yellow card for Jerome Kaino - which also costs Martyn, though
he does get a try from the same player plus a solitary Pat Lambie kick. Chris scores for a man-of-the-match performance from Ben Smith.</p>
<h2><a name="Sunday-18th-October" class="anchor" href="#Sunday-18th-October">Sunday 18th October</a></h2>
<h3><a name="Game-44" class="anchor" href="#Game-44">Game #44</a></h3>
<p><strong>Quarter-final 4: <a href="teams.html#Australia">Australia</a> 35 - 34 <a href="teams.html#Scotland">Scotland</a></strong></p>
<p>Was that the Scottish dressing room at half-time - or a homeless shelter in Govan?</p>
<p>Four-nil. A brilliant quarter-final weekend comes to a nerve-shredding (and somewhat contentious) end as an intelligent and committed
Scottish display ends in disappointment, leaving Australia shaken but somehow unbeaten - and ensuring that the Webb Ellis Cup remains in
the southern hemisphere. As you were in the table, albeit with Jack's lead trimmed and Martyn further adrift at the bottom. Chris gets
the bonus point Australian win, plus a man-of-the-match performance from Matt Giteau. Hugh picks up a Scottish bonus point in defeat,
sullied by a marginal yellow card for Sean Maitland. Susie scores via the dependable boot of Greig Laidlaw - and Rosie via the less
dependable kicking of Bernard Foley. Neph, Jem and Chad get tries from Adam Ashley-Cooper, Tevita Kuridrani and Michael Hooper
respectively.</p>
<p>The semi-finals have a lot to live up to...</p>
<h3><a name="Game-43" class="anchor" href="#Game-43">Game #43</a></h3>
<p><strong>Quarter-final 3: <a href="teams.html#Ireland">Ireland</a> 20 - 43 <a href="teams.html#Argentina">Argentina</a></strong></p>
<p>Almost an incredible comeback from Ireland - but a deserved Argentine victory makes it three-nil and leaves the hopes of the northern
hemisphere in the hands of Scotland (who have recorded two extremely dull wins over Australia in their last three meetings). Jack
stretches his lead with a near-flawless kicking display from Nicolas Sanchez, who also gets a rather questionable man-of-the-match
award. (To be fair, he was very good; I just think that Pablo Matera and Joaquin Tuculet were even better.) Chris picks up two tries
from Juan Imhoff, leaving Martyn in last place once again. Denis gets a try from Luke Fitzgerald - but with only four players left,
he's still in contention for the wooden spoon. The bonus point Argentine win (offset by a yellow card for Ramiro Herrera) takes Neph up
to second. Chad trundles on with a few points via the boot of Ian Madigan.</p>
<h2><a name="Saturday-17th-October" class="anchor" href="#Saturday-17th-October">Saturday 17th October</a></h2>

<p><strong>Quarter-final 2: <a href="teams.html#New Zealand">New Zealand</a> 62 - 13 <a href="teams.html#France">France</a></strong></p>
<p>"I don't see a punch; I just see a fist in the face." They could do with the calm semantics of Nigel Owens' refereeing at kicking-out
time in Port Talbot tonight...</p>
<p>Emphatically two-nil - and points for everyone other than Jack, Chad and Chris as the All Blacks turn on the style against a poor French
side. Jem leaps up to second thanks to three tries from man-of-the-match Julian Savea and one from Louis Picamoles (although the
latter's indiscipline costs him twice). Susie is up to sixth with the bonus point New Zealand win, a try from Brodie Retallick and
another monster kick from Scott Spedding. Hugh and Neph are tied for third after a try from Nehe Milner-Skudder for the former and a
solid kicking display from Dan Carter for the latter. Rosie picks up a meagre haul via the boot of Morgan Parra. Denis makes up ground
on Chad with a try from Kieran Read. And Martyn finally moves off the bottom with a try from Jerome Kaino, leaving Chris staring at the
prestigious wooden spoon.</p>
<h3><a name="Game-41" class="anchor" href="#Game-41">Game #41</a></h3>
<p><strong>Quarter-final 1: <a href="teams.html#South Africa">South Africa</a> 23 - 19 <a href="teams.html#Wales">Wales</a></strong></p>
<p>One-nil to the southern hemisphere after a brilliant bit of improvisation from Duane Vermeulen and Fourie de Preez. Jack stretches his
lead with a mixed kicking display from Handre Pollard and a thoroughly deserved man-of-the-match performance from Schalk Burger. Hugh
moves up to second thanks to the boot of Dan Biggar (though he might be concerned about how rapidly he's haemorrhaging players). Rosie
remains in fourth despite the South African win - and a Welsh bonus point in defeat is not enough to drag Martyn off the bottom.</p>
<h3><a name="Injury-update-11" class="anchor" href="#Injury-update-11">Injury update #11</a></h3>

<p><strong>Group B: <a href="teams.html#United States">United States</a> 18 - 28 <a href="teams.html#Japan">Japan</a></strong></p>
<p>Forty matches down and just eight to go... Jack has a healthy lead at the top, with Neph, Hugh, Rosie and Jem seemingly fighting it out
for the other places on the podium. And the battle to avoid the wooden spoon appears to be between Martyn and Chris.</p>
<p>Japan and the United States round off the group stages with another enjoyable match. No points for any sweepstakers though.</p>
<h3><a name="Game-39" class="anchor" href="#Game-39">Game #39</a></h3>
<p><strong>Group D: <a href="teams.html#France">France</a> 9 - 24 <a href="teams.html#Ireland">Ireland</a></strong></p>
<p>An attritional victory for Ireland sees them avoid the All Blacks in the quarter-finals - though at what cost (see injury update below)?
Denis powers away from the bottom two thanks to the Irish win and a man-of-the-match performance from Sean O'Brien. Dodgy kicking from
Frederic Michalak puts Jem in reverse. Neph picks up a few points from the boot of Jonathan Sexton; Susie and Rosie likewise from Scott
Spedding and Morgan Parra respectively. Chad hauls himself up to sixth with a try from Conor Murray and a decent kicking display from Ian
Madigan.</p>
<h3><a name="Injury-update-8" class="anchor" href="#Injury-update-8">Injury update #8</a></h3>
<p>Tony Woodcock (New Zealand) has been withdrawn through injury and replaced by Joe Moody. Martyn has picked Dean Mumm (Australia) as his
replacement</p>
<p>Liam Williams (Wales) and Jared Payne (Ireland) have also been withdrawn; their replacements will be announced next week. Awaiting
clarification from Denis as to his replacement for Liam Williams.</p>
<p>And Paul O'Connell, Peter O'Mahony and Jonathan Sexton (all Ireland) looked pretty dodgy leaving the pitch against France, so more news on
them in due course...</p>
<h3><a name="Game-38" class="anchor" href="#Game-38">Game #38</a></h3>
<p><strong>Group D: <a href="teams.html#Italy">Italy</a> 32 - 22 <a href="teams.html#Romania">Romania</a></strong></p>
<p>Farewell Italy and Romania. No points for anyone here.</p>
<h3><a name="Game-37" class="anchor" href="#Game-37">Game #37</a></h3>
<p><strong>Group C: <a href="teams.html#Argentina">Argentina</a> 64 - 19 <a href="teams.html#Namibia">Namibia</a></strong></p>
<p>A wonderful end to a very entertaining game as prop forward Johnny Redelinghuys - the first player to earn fifty caps for Namibia - ends
his international career with a piss-poor attempt at a conversion. Neph gets his bonus point Argentine win (slightly soured by a yellow
card for Marcelo Bosch that could easily have been a red), which leaves him tied for second after Hugh picks up a try from Leonardo
Senatore. Susie scores via a try from Juan Martin Hernandez.</p>
<h2><a name="Saturday-10th-October" class="anchor" href="#Saturday-10th-October">Saturday 10th October</a></h2>
<h3><a name="Game-36" class="anchor" href="#Game-36">Game #36</a></h3>
<p><strong>Group A: <a href="teams.html#England">England</a> 60 - 3 <a href="teams.html#Uruguay">Uruguay</a></strong></p>
<p>Pretty turgid stuff for the most part - but Jack will be happy that England finish the tournament as they started with both a bonus point
win and a penalty try. Rosie moves up to second thanks to a try from Henry Slade. Hugh continues his charge towards the top three with a
pair of tries from Anthony Watson. Flaky kicking from George Ford sees Susie take a small step backwards - but slightly better kicking from
Owen Farrell leaves Martyn marginally better off than he started the day.</p>
<h3><a name="Game-35" class="anchor" href="#Game-35">Game #35</a></h3>
<p><strong>Group A: <a href="teams.html#Australia">Australia</a> 15 - 6 <a href="teams.html#Wales">Wales</a></strong></p>
<p>Brilliant defence from an Australian team with two men in the bin earns them a quarter-final against Scotland. Unfortunately for Chris, the
Australian win is offset by yellow cards for Will Genia (also costly for Martyn) and Dean Mumm, plus a missed kick from Matt Giteau. Alex
Cuthbert's idiotic yellow card hurts both Chad and Martyn's Welsh team. Hugh increases the gap between the top and bottom halves of the
table despite Dan Biggar finally missing a kick. Rosie sneaks into third as Bernard Foley continues to impress.</p>
<h3><a name="Game-34" class="anchor" href="#Game-34">Game #34</a></h3>
<p><strong>Group B: <a href="teams.html#Samoa">Samoa</a> 33 - 36 <a href="teams.html#Scotland">Scotland</a></strong></p>
<p>Scotland sneak into the quarter-finals after a fine game. Can they now go all the way? It seems unlikely... The Scottish win (offset by a
yellow card for Ryan Wilson) keeps Hugh moving in the right direction though, whilst a try and the boot of Greig Laidlaw pull Susie towards
the middle of the pack.</p>
<h2><a name="Friday-9th-October" class="anchor" href="#Friday-9th-October">Friday 9th October</a></h2>

<p><strong>Group C: <a href="teams.html#New Zealand">New Zealand</a> 47 - 9 <a href="teams.html#Tonga">Tonga</a></strong></p>
<p>Points for everyone other than Jem, Rosie and Denis (unless you count minus points). Susie gets the bonus point New Zealand win - offset by
a yellow card for Kieran Read, which also costs Denis. At the top, Jack maintains his lead with a try from Sonny Bill Williams and Neph
moves up to second with a try from Ma'a Nonu (on his 100th appearance, a feat only matched by Brian O'Driscoll, Sergio Parisse and Adam
Ashley-Cooper) and an improved kicking display from Dan Carter. At the bottom, Martyn picks up a try from Tony Woodcock and Chris gets a
try from Ben Smith. In the middle, Chad gets a Sam Cane try - but the big winner is Hugh with two tries from man-of-the-match Nehe
Milner-Skudder.</p>
<h2><a name="Wednesday-7th-October" class="anchor" href="#Wednesday-7th-October">Wednesday 7th October</a></h2>

<p><strong>Group C: <a href="teams.html#Namibia">Namibia</a> 16 - 17 <a href="teams.html#Georgia">Georgia</a></strong></p>
<p>Thirty-two matches down, sixteen to go - and Jack continues to set the pace, with Jem, Neph and Rosie fighting for a place on the podium.
Plenty of time for fortunes to be made and lost, of course...</p>
<p>And after the longest and lowest-scoring first half in Rugby World Cup history, a compelling game finally finishes with the narrowest of
victories for Georgia - and a bonus point for Namibia (but will they have anything left in the tank when they face Argentina in just over
three-and-a-half days?). Jack stretches his lead with a farewell try from the ever-impressive Mamuka Gorgodze.</p>
<h3><a name="Game-31" class="anchor" href="#Game-31">Game #31</a></h3>
<p><strong>Group B: <a href="teams.html#South Africa">South Africa</a> 64 - 0 <a href="teams.html#United States">United States</a></strong></p>
<p>If Willem Alberts is "one hundred and twenty kilograms" of muscle, how much does he weigh in total?</p>
<p>Anyway, lots for the diligent updater to deal with after a brutal whitewash for the United States. Rosie rockets up to fourth with a bonus
point South African win, a penalty try, three tries for Bryan Habana, one for Bismarck du Plessis and a few kicks from Morne Steyn. Neph
hangs on to third with a pair of tries from Francois Louw. Chad continues his renaissance with a try from man-of-the-match Damian de
Allende. Martyn remains bottom despite tries from Jesse Kriel and Lwazi Mvovo. And Jack stretches his lead thanks to the boot of Handre
Pollard.</p>

<p>Well that was a feisty game. Consolation for Uruguay in the form of two tries - but their defeat means that England have qualified for the
2019 World Cup ;) ... Fiji's last hurrah proves fruitful for Chad with a bonus point win, two penalty tries and a try from man-of-the-match
Leone Nakarawa (offset by a slightly harsh yellow card for Campese Ma'afu who did little more than fend off a psychotic scrum-half). Neph
similarly benefits from Nemani Nadolo's last game of the tournament, a try and a decent kicking display consolidating his grip on third
place (no doubt temporarily).</p>

<p>The host nation fail to survive the Group of Death after a comprehensive defeat to an impressive Australia. Rosie rockets up for fourth
thanks to two tries and consummate kicking from Bernard Foley (who some might think was more deserving of the man-of-the-match award than,
uh, Joe Launchbury). Chris pulls away from the bottom with an Australian win and a try from Matt Giteau; Hugh picks up a try from Anthony

<p>Jack retakes the lead with a try from Schalk Burger and the reliable boot of Handre Pollard. Rosie gets the South African win (offset by a
yellow card for Jannie du Plessis) and a try from Bryan Habana. Jem gets a try from JP Pietersen. Susie picks up a few points from Greig
Laidlaw's kicking - offset by his yellow card, which also costs Hugh's Scottish team a couple of points.</p>

Kewell playbook.</p>

<p>Three tries from Julian Savea see Jem take the lead. The other big scorer is Chris who moves off the bottom following tries from Waisake
Naholo, Dane Coles and Malakai Fekitoa. Jack picks up points after another man-of-the-match performance from Mamuka Gorgodze. Susie gets
the bonus point New Zealand win; Denis gets a try from Kieran Read; and Neph gets a fairly miserable haul after Dan Carter misses a few
tricky conversions.</p>

<p>A good result for Jem who moves back into second after a bonus point French win and flawless kicking from man-of-the-match Frederic
Michalak. Denis and Neph pick up points via tries from Wesley Fofana and Guilhem Guirado respectively; Rosie ekes out a couple of points

<p>This means that as well as the pending replacements for Chris (back) and Hugh (forward), Jem and Martyn both need to pick a forward... Neph

<p>Awaiting clarification from Hugh as to who he wants to replace Billy Vunipola - and I need to decide on a replacement for Scott Williams...
And still waiting to hear from Chris about his replacement for Yoann Huget.</p>
<p>(Liam Williams remains in the Welsh squad, though won't be considered for the Fiji match. And common sense seems to have prevailed as far

<p>Get your protractors out! The reigning Five Nations champions earn a bonus point win over the reigning Olympic champions, which is good
news for Hugh who also picks up a couple of points from the boot of Finn Russell. Susie likewise benefits from Greig Laidlaw's kicking -

<p>A bonus point Australian win for Chris is slightly soured by a yellow card - and two tries from man-of-the-match Sean McMahon allow Chad to
leapfrog Chris at the bottom. Quade Cooper had a great game with ball in hand - but his rubbish kicking and indiscipline lead to a solitary
point for Martyn. Jack powers on with a try from Matt 'Top-knot' Toomua; Jem snaps at his heels with a last-gap try from Tevita Kuridrani.
Henry Speight scores a try to keep Hugh in third, closely followed by Neph thanks to a pair of tries from Ben McCalman.</p>

<p>Sixteen matches down, thirty-two to go - and the hosts are teetering on the brink...</p>
<p>Disappointment for England at somehow losing despite dominating the set-pieces and edging the aerial battle - and elation for a resilient
Wales who finished the game playing two scrum-halves, two fly-halves and one centre. I still wouldn't want to predict which two teams will
survive the Group of Death. (And barring a miracle recovery, I'll start thinking about my replacement for Scott Williams; Denis might want
to do likewise given the way Liam Williams left the field.) Jack stretches his lead with an English losing bonus point and a try from Jonny
May. Martyn gets motoring with a Welsh win and nerveless kicking from Owen Farrell - but even that impressive haul is topped by Hugh who
rockets up to third thanks to equally solid kicking (not withstanding his itching-powder-everywhere preparation) and a deserved
man-of-the-match performance from Dan Biggar.</p>

Lambie. A try from Schalk Burger and some flaky kicking from man-of-the-match Handre Pollard sees Jack storm past the century mark, closely
followed by Jem (who could have taken the lead if the great unwashed of Twitter had voted for Eben Etzebeth) thanks to three tries from JP

<p>A very expensive yellow card for Georgia helps Argentina to a bonus point win that keeps Neph moving in the right direction. Jack extends
his lead (despite the indiscipline of Mamuka Gorgodze) after another assured kicking display from Nicolas Sanchez (including the first drop
goal of the tournament). Chris continues the long haul back to contention with a pair of tries from Juan Imhoff, leaving Chad propping up
the table once more.</p>

<p>Not sure that Steve Hansen is going to be too happy with that ragged display from the All Blacks. Still, Susie gets the expected bonus
point win. Hugh doubles his tally with a pair of tries (and another head-scratching man-of-the-match award) for Nehe Milner-Skudder. Chris
nearly drags himself off the bottom with tries from Malakei Fekitoa and Ben Smith. But the big winner is Jem who moves up to joint-second
with two tries from Julian Savea and one each for Victor Vito and Beauden Barrett (plus some erratic kicking from the latter).</p>

<p>A bonus point French win scores points for Jem. Denis is snapping at Jack's heels after a try (and a somewhat mystifying man-of-the-match
award) for Wesley Fofana. (Brice Dulin would have got my vote. Sadly that's not how it works...) Morgan Parra does what Morgan Parra
usually does, which translates to some welcome points for Rosie. And Susie continues to sneak towards the right end of the table with a try

<p>No bonus point for Australia - but the win sees Chris creep back into positive territory. Jem slips back as a result of Tevita Kuridrani's
yellow card; Campese Ma'afu's indiscipline likewise costs Chad. The big winner is Jack, who takes the lead thanks to two tries from
man-of-the-match David Pocock; Neph stays in touch with some successful kicks from Nemani Nadolo; and Rosie benefits from Bernard Foley's

<p>A New Zealand win and man-of-the-match Brodie Retallick help Susie pull away from the bottom two, whilst Chad likewise keeps moving in the
right direction with tries from Sam Cane and Aaron Smith. Solid kicking from the impressive Nicolas Sanchez allows Jack to make up ground
on Denis. Neph edges back in front, albeit with Dan Carter's ever-reliable kicking offset by Argentine (Pablo Matera) and Kiwi (Conrad
Smith, of all people) indiscipline. And a yellow card for Richie McCaw leaves Chris hoping for better things when we resume on Wednesday.</p>

decent player).</p>
<p>Martyn continues creeping up the table thanks to a bonus point Welsh win; Jack consolidates third place with a try from Justin Tipuric

a try for Rosie; Scott Spedding gives Susie a small boost.</p>

<p>Wow! A stunning performance from Japan in one of the best games I've even seen. (Shane Williams wasn't wrong when he said that Japan would
play for the full eighty minutes.)</p>
<p>Mixed results for Rosie: tries from Bismarck du Plessis and Adriaan Strauss - but nil points for South Africa (their two bonus points being
offset by Coenie Oosthuizen's yellow card). Francois Louw and Michael Leitch do the business for Neph; Pat Lambie and Handre Pollard keep

<p>Denis races out to an early lead thanks to a deserved man-of-the-match performance from Mike Brown in, frankly, a pretty scrappy game. Jack
gets a bonus point English win and a penalty try to boot. Hugh scores via the slimmed-down Billy Vunipola; Neph via man-mountain Nemani
Nadolo (or "Nandolo", as Nick Mullins insists on calling him; maybe he's thinking of Nando's?). Martyn and Susie pick up points from the
boots of Owen Farrell and George Ford respectively. And a yellow card for Nikola Matawalu (who almost redeemed himself with what would have
been a brilliant try) leave Chad stuck in reverse gear.</p>
<h4><a name="A-brief-note-on-replacements" class="anchor" href="#A-brief-note-on-replacements">A brief note on replacements</a></h4>
<p>Once the tournament is underway, if one of your players is withdrawn, I'll try and let you know (or you can let me know). You can then pick
any unpicked player as a replacement - with the proviso that you will only be credited with points that they score from that point onwards.
(If there's a sudden spate of withdrawals, replacements will be allocated on a first-come first-served basis.)</p>
<p>Please note that a player who is unavailable for disciplinary reasons (e.g. Mariano Galarza for Argentina) cannot be replaced.</p>
<h4><a name="Payout-structure" class="anchor" href="#Payout-structure">Payout structure</a></h4>
<p>The payout structure will be: fifty quid for first place; thirty quid for second place; and twenty quid for third place. (Sorry,
<strike>Denis</strike> <strike>Chad</strike> <strike>Chris</strike> Martyn, no wooden spoon prize this time.)</p>
